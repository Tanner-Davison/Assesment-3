		<h1>About</h1>

		<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Hey everyone, my name is Tanner and I'm a
		fun-loving, outgoing YouTube personality who loves to code! I'm a full-time coder and programming enthusiast with a plethora of knowledge in tech. I enjoy exploring new technologies and building exciting projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. When I'm not coding, you can find me making videos on my YouTube channel, sharing my knowledge and experiences with my audience. I'm passionate about using my skills to make the world a better place, and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to meaningful projects that have a positive impact on society. So whether you're a fellow coder, a tech enthusiast, or just someone looking to learn something new, I'm excited to connect with you and share my love of coding and tech!
